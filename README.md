# ExtMem

ExtMem is a framework for user level memory management. ExtMem is implemented as a user-space library that attaches to applications. The current version supports memory paging (swap) and eviction and prefetching policies based on page table access bits. See the publication for details.

This repository contains our artifact for the ATC'24 paper. Follow the instructions in this doc to reproduce the paper results.

## Getting started

Clone this repository and set up its submodules. 

    git clone git@github.com:SepehrDV2/ExtMem.git
    cd ExtMem
    git submodule update --init


You need to build and install the provided custom kernel for the best results. Then build and install the kernel inside Linux directory. ExtMem also needs the custom kernel headers. Follow any Linux installation guide for dependencies.

    # basic dependencies
    sudo apt install bc binutils bison dwarves flex gcc git gnupg2 gzip libelf-dev libncurses5-dev libssl-dev make openssl pahole perl-base rsync tar xz-utils
    sudo apt install liburing-dev liburing2 # io_uring library
    cd linux
    make oldconfig # assuming X86
    make menuconfig # ensure userfaultfd and uring are enabled
    make -j $(nproc)
    sudo make headers_install INSTALL_HDR_PATH=usr/include # important, we put headers in the source file
    # next steps install the actual kernel on your machine
    sudo make install 
    sudo make INSTALL_MOD_STRIP=1 modules_install 
    # update your grub and reboot

ExtMem uses libsyscall_intercept to redirect memory related system calls. Build and install this library from source:
https://github.com/pmem/syscall_intercept

Build ExtMem in the src directory: 

    make libextmem-default.so # make default policy
    make all # all policies

You can link ExtMem to any application. Pass the swap file directory as environment variable. It is recommended to give a async IO capable SSD storage partition. Set the DRAM limit of the application running ExtMem with environment variable. Don't limit an ExtMem-based application with Cgroups.

    DRAMSIZE=size_in_bytes SWAPDIR=/swap/device/path LD_PRELOAD=/path/to/extmem/src/libextmem-default.so ./your-executable

As an example run the random microbenchmark with 8GB of memory.

    cd swap-microbenchmarks/mmapbench
    g++ -O3 -g mmapbench.cpp -o mmapbench -ltbb -pthread # build the microbenchmark
    DRAMSIZE=8589934592 SWAPDIR=/dev/nvme1n1p2 LD_PRELOAD=/path/to/libextmem-default.so timeout 180s  ./mmapbench  /dev/null  1  1  0  0  1
    


## Kernel
The kernel is based on Linux 5.15 with modifications in userfaultfd and signal handler. Build following any Linux installation guide.

## Microbenchmarks
We use [mmapbench](https://github.com/SepehrDV2/mmap-anon-benchmarks/tree/extmem-eval) for microbenchmarks. Refer to its repository for running documentation. 

    cd swap-microbenchmarks/mmapbench
    g++ -O3 -g mmapbench.cpp -o mmapbench -ltbb -pthread # build the microbenchmark

Use scripts in swap-microbenchmarks/eval-scripts for evaluation. 
## Benchmarks
Currently we have tested ExtMem with [GAP](https://github.com/SepehrDV2/gapbs) benchmark suite for graph processing. 

    # building the gap benchmark
    cd swap-benchmarks/gapbs
    make
    make test
    
Prepare the twitter dataset.

Running PageRank:

    DRAMSIZE=8589934592 SWAPPATH=/dev/nvme1n1p2 LD_PRELOAD=/path/to/libextmem-pagerank.so ./pr -f ../datasets/twitter/snap.el

## Hardware Requirements
Given a dedicated swap file ExtMem can run on any multi-core X86 machine that can run the Linux 5.15>= kernel. 
For the best performance we recommend a dedicated NVMe SSD partition with async IO and at least 16 cores. 
## Reproducing paper results
The experiments were run on a 2-socket machine (16 cores, 32 hardware threads each) with 2.30GHz Intel Xeon 5218 processors and 198GB of DDR4 DRAM, running a modified Linux 5.15. We used an NVMe SSD disk with 2700MB/S read rate. We recommend using similar hardware for reproducing paper results. 

Once you built the library and mmapbench and gapbs, you can use the scripts provided in the run-scripts directory to recreate the results in the paper.

Preparing:

    cd run-scripts
    ./build-extmem.sh
    ./build-microbenchmarks.sh
    ./build-pagerank.sh
  

mmapbench
(~45 minutes runtime time to get results, ~15 minutes to run commands and interpret results)

You can run these scripts to reproduce mmapbench experiment results:

    sudo ./run-mmapbench.sh # generate extmem results
    sudo ./run-mmapbench-baseline.sh # generate Linux cgroup results

Each will take ~30 minutes to run. They would require root privilege to change the swap device. This will generate a set of csv log files showing the throughput per second. To interpret these files, fifth columns is time and sixth column is throughput. You can use the python scripts provided to generate each of the figures in section 4.2.

    python3 random-plot.py
    python3 sequential-plot.py
    python3 workingset-plot.py

gapbs
(~15 minutes preparation time, ~1.5 hour runtime)

To reproduce the experiment in the paper. First prepare the Twitter dataset:

    prepare-tw-dataset.sh

This will download and extract the dataset files in run-scripts/twitter_compressed
snap.el is the graph file used in gap.

Then run the experiments:

    sudo ./run-pr.sh # run with both extmem default and pagerank
    sudo ./run-pre-baseline.sh # in-memory and cgroup limits

  

Each of these will read the dataset, build the graph, and run the iterations. The iterations time will appear on output, showing the timing results section 4.3. Note that the graph building phase is time consuming (~20 minutes each experiment) so give it time before iterations begin.

## Acknowledgment
Some parts of this implementation were derived from [hemem](https://bitbucket.org/ajaustin/hemem/src). We have adopted their API, syscall interception code and also some utilities from their codebase. We also adopted some of their kernel patches for userfaultfd interface in our kernel tree.
